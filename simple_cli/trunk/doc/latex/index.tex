Simple C\+L\+I is C/\+C++ Command line interface parser. It works as parser for execution of program functions. Its advantages are easy use and small amount of code.

Code compiles with C and C++ compilers. Example project is written with Visual Studio Express 2013, but code can easly be used with other compilers (e.\+g. G\+C\+C) with small modifications.

Main purpouse of this software module is to be used in embedded systems for interface between microprocessor controlled device and human or P\+C software.
